# Sample: Technical Debt

> Document shortcuts taken during development and improvements needed for production readiness.

## What is Technical Debt?

Technical debt refers to:
- Quick solutions that need refining
- Features not yet implemented
- Known limitations
- Future improvements

**This is NOT failure** - it's honest reflection on what you'd improve with more time.

## Current Technical Debt

### High Priority
**Items that would cause problems in production**

1. **[Issue Name]**
   - **Location**: `filename.py` line X or `module/function`
   - **Problem**: What's wrong or incomplete?
   - **Impact**: Why does this matter?
   - **Solution**: How would you fix it?
   - **Effort**: Estimated time to fix

**Example**:
1. **Hard-coded file paths**
   - **Location**: `ingestion.py` lines 23, 45, 67
   - **Problem**: Paths like `/data/file.csv` won't work on other systems
   - **Impact**: Pipeline fails when deployed to different environments
   - **Solution**: Use environment variables or config file
   - **Effort**: 2 hours

### Medium Priority
**Items that should be addressed but aren't urgent**

1. **[Issue Name]**
   - **Location**: 
   - **Problem**: 
   - **Solution**: 
   - **Effort**: 

**Example**:
1. **Incomplete test coverage**
   - **Location**: `test_ingestion.py`
   - **Problem**: Excel loading function only has 65% coverage
   - **Impact**: Edge cases might not be caught
   - **Solution**: Add tests for malformed Excel files, empty sheets
   - **Effort**: 1-2 hours

---

### Low Priority
**Nice-to-have improvements**

1. **[Issue Name]**
   - **Location**: 
   - **Problem**: 
   - **Solution**: 
   - **Effort**: 

**Example**:
1. **Long functions**
   - **Location**: `cleaning.py` - `standardize_dates()` is 50 lines
   - **Problem**: Hard to test individual parts, difficult to maintain
   - **Solution**: Break into smaller functions
   - **Effort**: 1 hour

## Known Limitations

**What this pipeline DOESN'T do (by design or time constraints)**:

- [ ] TODO: List functionality not implemented
- [ ] TODO: Example: "Only processes 3 file types (CSV, JSON, Excel)"
- [ ] TODO: Example: "No streaming support - batch processing only"
- [ ] TODO: Example: "No retry logic for failed transformations"
- [ ] TODO: Example: "No data versioning or rollback capability"

---

## Future Enhancements

**Features to add in future iterations**:

### Next Sprint
- [ ] TODO: What would you add next?
- [ ] Example: Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Example: Implement data quality dashboard

### Next Quarter  
- [ ] TODO: Longer-term improvements
- [ ] Example: Add real-time streaming support
- [ ] Example: Implement data lineage tracking

### Wishlist
- [ ] TODO: Dream features
- [ ] Example: ML-based data quality anomaly detection
- [ ] Example: Automated data profiling and documentation

## Code Quality Issues

**Areas where code quality could be improved**:

- TODO: List code smells or anti-patterns
- Example: "Repeated code in ingestion functions - could create base class"
- Example: "Magic numbers in validation rules - should be constants"
- Example: "Inconsistent error handling - some functions raise, some return None"

---

## Performance Concerns

**Areas where performance could be improved**:

- TODO: Identify bottlenecks
- Example: "Loading entire CSV into memory - doesn't scale to large files"
- Example: "No parallel processing - pipeline is sequential"
- Example: "Date parsing is slow - could cache format detection"

---

## Security & Compliance Gaps

**Security measures not yet implemented**:

- TODO: List security improvements needed
- Example: "No encryption for data at rest"
- Example: "Secrets stored in code (should use Key Vault)"
- Example: "No audit logging for data access"
- Example: "RLS not implemented (see SECURITY.md)"

---

## Dependencies & Maintenance

**Dependency-related concerns**:

- TODO: List dependency issues
- Example: "Using older version of Pandas (1.5.0) - should upgrade to 2.x"
- Example: "No automated dependency scanning"
- Example: "Some libraries have known vulnerabilities (check `pip audit`)"

---

## Documentation Gaps

**Documentation that needs improvement**:

- TODO: List missing or incomplete docs
- Example: "No API reference documentation"
- Example: "Setup instructions incomplete for Windows users"
- Example: "No troubleshooting guide"
- Example: "Function docstrings missing examples"

---

## Lessons Learned

**What would you do differently next time?**

1. TODO: Reflect on the process
2. Example: "Start with tests earlier (test-driven development)"
3. Example: "Spend more time on architecture planning"
4. Example: "Use a linter from day 1 (would have caught many issues)"
5. Example: "Set up CI/CD on day 1 (not day 3)"

## Estimated Total Effort to Address

| Priority  | Items | Estimated Effort |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| High      | TODO  | TODO hours       |
| Medium    | TODO  | TODO hours       |
| Low       | TODO  | TODO hours       |
| **Total** | TODO  | TODO hours       |

## Notes

**Remember**: 
- Technical debt is normal and expected
- Documenting it shows maturity and professionalism
- The goal isn't zero debt - it's managed, intentional debt
- Every project has trade-offs between speed and perfection

**When to address**:
- High priority: Before production deployment
- Medium priority: In next sprint/iteration
- Low priority: When time permits or if causing pain
